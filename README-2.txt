Decimal to Binary Converter
---------------------------

Description:
This program takes a decimal number as input and converts it into binary form.
It uses a stack (linked list) to convert the integer part and a queue (linked list) for the fractional part.

Files:
- Stack.h / Stack.cpp : Stack class (linked list)
- Queue.h / Queue.cpp : Queue class (linked list)
- Main.cpp            : Main logic and I/O
- README.txt          : This file

Usage:
Compile all files together and run the program. Enter a decimal value like 13.625.
The output will be the binary equivalent: 1101.101
